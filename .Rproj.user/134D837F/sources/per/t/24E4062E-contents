We are a team of researchers and scientists at [Baylor College of Medicine](https://www.bcm.edu/), located in the heart of [Texas Medical Center](https://www.tmc.edu/) in Houston. Our primary focus is on the human health effects of air toxics. Specifically, we develop geospatial modeling methods to map and analyze the distribution of different air toxics. Besides that, we integrate these models with health data to investigate the impact of air toxics on various adverse health outcomes. Our approach is both comprehensive and multidisciplinary, overlapping with atmospheric science, environmental science, public health, bioinformatics, and data analytics.
